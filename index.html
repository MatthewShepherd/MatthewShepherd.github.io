Lets take a look at my top rated games and figure out which one is the best!

  	<p>
  	<strong>World of Warcraft</strong> is an MMORPG made by <i>Blizzard Entertainment<i>. It has been around for many years and still appeals to millions of players to this day. The game has more content than you could possibly imagine and the large player base is great for making friends or getting help on soliving those hard quests.
  	</p>
  	<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Massive amounts of content</p>
  	<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lots of time commitment required to be competitive</p>

    <h2>Overwatch</h2>
