    <h1>My Top Games</h1>

    <h3>Intro</h3>

    <p>
       <strong>Video games</strong> have been a hobby of mine for a while. Over the years I have tried different types of games from different companies. I will be listing a few games and giving a description of them. There are different genres and styles of games that I will be discussing below along with some pros and cons. Lets take a look at my top rated games and figure out which one is the best!
    </p>

    <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>

  	<p>
  	<strong>World of Warcraft</strong> is an MMORPG made by <i>Blizzard Entertainment</i>. It has been around for many years and still appeals to millions of players to this day. The game has more content than you could possibly imagine and the large player base is great for making friends or getting help on soliving those hard quests.
  	</p>
  	<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Massive amounts of content</p>
  	<p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lots of time commitment required to be competitive</p>

    <h2>Overwatch</h2>

    <p><strong>Overwatch</strong> is an exciting fast-paced first person shooter also by <i>Blizzard Entertainment</i>. It has a huge player base and tons of replay value. This objective based FPS has differnt types of characters with unique abilities and roles. You can grab a controller and squeeze in a 30 minute match before you start your day to get your fix. Group up with 5 other players and take on your rivals in some friendly competition!
    </p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick games and many characters to pick from</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Addicting</p>

    <h2>Rocket League</h2>

    </p>

    <p><strong>Rocket League</strong> has to be one of the funniest video games I have ever played. My first experienced consisted of laughing with my friends until I formed 6 pack abs. Ok, so I dont really have a 6 pack. This game can be described as rocket propelled Hotwheel like cars flying through the air, riding on walls and slamming into a soccer ball and aiming at your opponents net. Psyonix designed this action sports game to appeal to a wide range of people.</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Hilarious game at a reasonable price</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Frustratingly large skill curve that can make you feel helpless in the hands of a strong opponent</p>

    <h1>Fallout</h1>

    </p>

    <p><strong>Fallout</strong> is an FPS style RPG. It takes place in a post apocalyptic setting mostly inhabited by cyborgs and mutants. The role playing aspect means making alliances and enemies while improving skill points and trying to find yourself some rare loot. I have to admit, once you start this game, its hard to put down. <i>Bethesda Softworks</i> did a great job making this game exciting and addicting with tons of options to alter your characters traits and attributes. This is not an online game so it gets a little lonely out there in that nuclear scorched earth. Guess I'll just make friends with this robot!</p>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Sandbox style game with lots to do</p>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Single player</p>
